# Events
The SSA organizes events throughout the academic year! Key events to watch out for include:

## First-Year Webinar
To help new freshmen prepare for life at CMU, the First-Year Webinar is a orientation over Zoom filled with interactive
activities and opportunities for the new freshmen to get to know the current students as well as one another.

First-year webinar 2024 will be held on the 9th of June, 2024 (Sunday) at 10am SGT.

## Fall Picnic
If you're feeling homesick during your first few weeks in Pittsburgh and want to hear a large group of individuals 
speaking in Singaporean accents, drop by SSA’s Fall Picnic!

## Winter Shopping Trip at Grove City
Coming from Singapore and have no idea what kind of winter clothes you need? Don’t worry! In the first few weeks of fall, SSA will have a winter shopping trip to Grove City—where you can not only find everything you need for winter, but also mingle with other SSA members.

## Spring Carnival Booth
Spring Carnival is an annual CMU tradition filled with carnival food, games, and events. One such event is the construction of student organization booths—where we will come together and build multi-storey structures of a chosen theme. These booths include interactive games and decorative elements. 

In 2024, SSA collaborated with the Hong Kong Students' Association and Fillipino Students Association for Booth, winning 2nd prize in the blitz category.
